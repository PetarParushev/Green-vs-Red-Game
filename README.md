# Green-vs-Red-Game
MentorMate Task Project

A 2D grid game where every grid cell is either green or red. On every turn colors change depending on certain rules.

I kept the program as simple as possible in order to perform fast and to be easy to read and understand. Even though it's an actual game it's also just few algorithms.
